        <h2>Founding facts</h2>
        
        <p>In 1996 the Cleveland Browns owner Art Model moved the beloved 
        Cleveland Browns team to Baltimore. Baltimore had been without a 
        professional football team for 12 years, after the Baltimore Colts 
        owner Robert Irsay moved the team in a snowstorm in 1984. The picture
        of the snowy Mayflower truck all packed up still incites sadness from
        beloved colts fans who remember the day that broke Baltimores heart.</p>
        
        <p> Baltimore will be forever greatful to Art Model for bringing 
        professional football back to baltimore.</p>

        draft produced two of the Baltimore Ravens most beloved and future hall
        of fame players left tackle <strong>Johnathan Ogden</strong> 
        and linebacker <strong>Ray Lewis</strong>. The team went 4-12 the first 
        season. In 1997, the team drafted a key impact player outside linebacker 
        Peter Bowlware who won the AFC Defensive rookie of the year. The team 
        finished 6-9-1. In 1998, despite adding talent to the offense and 
        defensive sides of theball still ended up with a record of 6-10. Head

        <h2>The Coach Billick years (1999-2007)</h2>
        
        <p><img src="Brian Billick.jpeg"></p>
        
        <p>In the 8 years that Brian Billick coached the Baltimore Ravens we saw
        tremendous growth and arguably one of the greatest defense's in modern
        NFL history. Coach Billick was an offensive coordinator with the 
        Minnesota Vikings from 1992-1998. In that time he helped the team reach
        the playoffs 6 of the 7 years he was there and in 1998 set a record for
        most points scored that stood for 9 years. In 1999, coach Billick lead
        the Ravens to an 8-8 record and their first season they didn't have a 
        losing record. Also during the end of the season <em>Art Model</em>
        sold the team to current owner <strong>Steve Biscotti</strong>. </p>
        
        <p>In the 2000 season the Baltimore Ravens would finish the season with 
        a record of 12-4. The first true winning season for the Ravens and it was
        not normal at all. They won most games of the season by imposing their
        tough run defense on offenses causing them to to become pass heavy to
        be able to move the ball. Despite only scoring a total of 29 touchdowns
        for the entire season they were able to make up the difference with 
        defensive touchdowns and field goals. They were a wildcard team and were
        forced to play away games against the Broncos, Titans, and Raiders.
        They won all 3 games and made it to Superbowl 35 against the New York
        Giants. They won that game 34-7 and were crowned Super Bowl 35 champions.

        <p>2001 the Ravens were 10-6 and made the playoffs but were eliminated in 
        first round. In 2002, they were 7-9 and were forced to part ways with
        9 impact players which ultimately played a factor to the losing record.
        In 2003, The Ravens won the AFC North title at 10-6 and made the playoffs 
        again. They were eliminated in the first round. The Ravens would make the
        Playoffs 2 more seasons before Coach Billick was replaced by Coach
        John Harbaugh in 2008. Coach Billick would have an overall record of 
        80-64.</p>
